A few things to clarify:
double dipping: this means counting your hours in multiple programs (YSWSs)
CONSTRUCT FAQ

What is this?
-------------

Construct is a YSWS where you create CAD designs, and we'll ship you a 3d printer! You can get started by making a project on [construct.hackclub.com](http://construct.hackclub.com/)!!!

When does Construct end?
------------------------

This program ends on 15th Feb, so remember to submit your project before the end!

How can I earn prizes?
----------------------

For every hour you work and journal, you shall receive 1 bag of clay!\
Clay is the currency that you can use to buy a 3D printer! The cheapest printer is 40 clay!\
After you buy a 3D printer, you will start receiving bricks instead of clay! 12 per hour! Bricks can be used to purchase items in the Brick Shop! They can also be used to upgrade your printer.\
If you don't wish to buy a 3D printer, you may convert your clay bag into bricks. This is done by Ovenpheus at a rate of 10 bricks for 1 clay, upon request. You will continue to earn clay bags, which you can still convert. (This is in place in case you want to change your mind in the near future)\


How many projects can I make?
-----------------------------

You can make as many projects as you like, as long as each project meets the 2-hour minimum requirement!\
Longer projects will gain you a higher shop score, so aim for . Please avoid copying other projects 1:1 or you will be chased by Orpheus.

How do I track my time?
-----------------------

When you make a project on [construct.hackclub.com](https://construct.hackclub.com/), there will be a journal attached where you can record your time & log what you do over time on your project.\
Journal logs are capped at 2 hours, regardless of how long you spent on that journal. You cannot spam 2 hour logs continuously. The time between from one journal to the next is recorded, and you may only journal on what time has elapsed since your last journal. (Only applicable if less then two hours have elapsed since last journal)\
If you lose hours on your work, then there's nothing we can do, if we give you extra minutes/hours then there isn't any point in having a journaling system like this.\
***NOTE: We DO NOT need hackatime! There is no hackatime support/documentation for most cad software.***

Can I work on multiple short projects?
--------------------------------------

Yes, as long as each project meets the 2-hour minimum requirement.

What can I make?
----------------

You can make anything you want, as long as it is designed to be 3D printable. This can be a keyring, or a model of Orpheus, it could even just be some random thing that you like!\
You can't make things with parts, electrical or non electrical. This includes bearings, motors, pcbs and wiring, although you can use nuts and bolts in common standard sizes such as M3, M5 etc (though don't go above M6).

Does Construct allow group projects?
------------------------------------

For now, we are not allowing group projects sorry.

**Do yall accept remixes?**
---------------------------

Sadly, no, although you are free to make a copy project your own way, provided you didn't follow a tutorial 1:1.

Can I continue working on existing project?
-------------------------------------------

Yes! Although we will only count the hours starting from the start date of construct!

Do I have to build my project?
------------------------------

Your project will have to be physically produced to count as shipped (we've been told this by people at HQ!). There are a few ways that can happen:

-   Someone on Printables thinks your project is cool and posts a make of it!
-   If you already have a printer, you print it yourself and put photos of it on Printables.
-   One of our printers prints it for you and posts a make of it (this is the default if your project doesn't have any makes or photos, also we will take a really small cut of your payout to cover the filament ).
-   [Coming soon] You select that you want it shipped to you after printing and it is handled through the [#printing-legion](https://slack.com/archives/C083P4FJM46).

We will print the parts you make at the cost of your earnings, the cost scales with the amount of filament your project requires, so please try keep your projects as physically small as possible if you want us to print it.\
***NOTE: We cannot send a 3d printer before you ship your models, this is because there are some people who, in bad faith, will just take the 3d printer and leave.***

Where does my earnings go to when I get someone to print for me?
----------------------------------------------------------------

Your earnings go towards the cost of filament, this is charged @ 2 cents per gram.

What happens if I double-dip with [#fraud-ysws](https://slack.com/archives/C09B27RC0FL) (commit fraud)?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hour inflation is not tolerated in hack club, or in any of its sponsored programs.\
If you are caught committing hour inflation (fraud) then you will be banned from this ysws, and all current and future ysws, for an indefinite amount of time.\
If you believe you have been banned unfairly, please dm [@Fraud Squad](https://hackclub.enterprise.slack.com/team/U091HC53CE8). This is the only way you can appeal.\
If you get unbanned, after frauding, then you will lose all your currency and all your projects will be deleted.\
If we have made an error, then it will be overturned with no loss in currency.\
Please do not fraud as it takes attention away from people who truly work honestly.

When's the last submission date?
--------------------------------

The last submission date is the 15th of February, at 11:59 PM Eastern standard time.\
Journaling will be disabled on February 14th, 2026. 11:59PM EST\
New project making will be disabled at the same time.\
Both shops close on the 1st of March, 2026, 11:59PM EST. Currency beyond this point will be destroyed.\
If you have enough clay but didn't buy a printer, you will be automatically sent a 180 dollar grant.

How will fulfilment take place?
-------------------------------

Most fulfilment will happen via website. You will be notified when your item is fulfilled.\
In the event, if your item is wayyy overpriced, you will be dmed by someone to either:\
A. Be asked to give us a link on what thing we should buy for you, on your behalf (for high priced items)\
B. Be given a grant to buy the item yourself (for more, lower priced items)\
C. Be given a refund on your currency.

There is an option to get your own 3d printer. The price of the printer can be anywhere from $180 dollars to an indefinite amount!

What software do you support?
-----------------------------

Here's the list of CAD software you can use:

-   Fusion 360
-   Onshape
-   FreeCAD
-   OpenSCAD
-   Blender (for more organic stuff)
-   Shapr3D
-   Solidworks

No other CAD software please.\
The latest list can be found [here!](https://construct.hackclub.com/approved-editors)

I'm new to CAD design and it takes me longer to complete tasks. Is that okay?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Absolutely! We welcome beginners. However, please note that research/tutorials time (like looking up how to perform specific functions in your software) is not counted toward your project hours. Only active work on the project itself counts.

Is Construct double dippable?
-----------------------------

Unfortunately no, unless it's for fusering!\
*To double dip with fusering, first log your hours here in construct, then just submit to fusering, then once you get your model, ship in construct!*

Who runs this?
--------------

Our team is led by a crew of 8 people. They've worked around the clock to help make this ysws come to life!
