A few things to clarify:
double dipping: this means counting your hours in multiple programs (YSWSs)

How does Construct work?
------------------------

Construct is a YSWS where you create CAD designs (and make them in real life), and we'll ship you a 3d printer! You can get started by making a project on [construct.hackclub.com](http://construct.hackclub.com/)! (the site is coming soon :pf:)

When does Construct end?
------------------------

This program ends on 15th Feb, so remember to submit your project before the end!

How can I earn prizes?
----------------------

For every hour you work and journal, you shall receive 1 bag of clay!\
Clay is the currency that you can use to buy a 3D printer! The cheapest printer is 45 clay.\
After you buy a 3D printer, you will start receiving bricks instead of clay! 10 per hour! Bricks can be used to purchase items in the Brick Shop! They can also be used to upgrade your printer.\
If you don't wish to buy a 3D printer, you may convert your clay bag into bricks. This is done by Ovenpheus at a rate of 9 bricks for 1 bag of clay, upon request. You will continue to earn clay bags, which you can still convert. (This is in place in case you want to change your mind in the near future)\
Alternatively, when you buy a base 3D printer, you won't need the help of Ovenpheus as you'll get a free, super cool - Firing Oven 2000 :tm: : which converts your bags of clay automatically at the rate of 10 bricks for every 1 bag of clay.\


How many projects can I make?
-----------------------------

You can make as many projects as you like, as long as each project meets the 2-hour minimum requirement! Please refrain from copying other projects 1:1.

How do I track my time?
-----------------------

When you make a project on [construct.hackclub.com](https://construct.hackclub.com/), there will be a journal attached where you can record your time & log what you do over time on your project.\
Journal logs are capped at 2 hours, regardless of how long you spent on that journal. You cannot spam 2 hour logs continuously. The time between from one journal to the next is recorded, and you may only journal on what time has elapsed since your last journal. (Only applicable if less then two hours have elapsed since last journal)\
If you lose hours on your work, then there's nothing we can do, if we give you extra minutes/hours then there isn't any point in having a journaling system like this.

Can I work on multiple short projects?
--------------------------------------

Yes, as long as each project meets the 2-hour minimum requirement.

What can I make?
----------------

You can make anything that is created with CAD. This can be a keychain, or a model of Orpheus! It could even just be some random thing that you like!

Does Construct allow group projects?
------------------------------------

For now, we are not allowing group projects

Can I continue working on existing project?
-------------------------------------------

Yes! Although we will only count the hours starting from the start date of construct!

Do I have to build my project?
------------------------------

This is slightly complicated. You will need to have it on [printables.com](http://printables.com) but you'll need to have a make there (Have a physically printed image). The make can be printed from someone on printables or you can print it if you have a 3d printer. Alternatively, you can have us print it and send an image to you for a small cut of your earnings! If we print it for you, you won't get it shipped to your house.

What happens if I commit the act of hour inflation (fraud)?
-----------------------------------------------------------

Hour inflation is not tolerated in hack club, or in any of its sponsored programs.\
If you are caught commuting hour inflation (fraud) then you will be banned from this ysws, and all current and future ysws, for an indefinite amount of time.\
If you believe you have been banned unfairly, please dm [@Fraud Squad](https://hackclub.enterprise.slack.com/team/U091HC53CE8). This is the only way you can appeal.\
If you get unbanned, after frauding, then you will lose all your currency and all your projects will be deleted.\
If we have made an error, then it will be overturned with no loss in currency.\
Please do not fraud as it takes attention away from people who truly work honestly.

When's the last submission date?
--------------------------------

The last submission date is the 15th of February, at 11:59 PM Eastern standard time.\
Journalling will be disabled on February 14th, 2026. 11:59PM EST\
New project making will be disabled at the same time.\
Both shops close on the 1st of March, 2026, 11:59PM EST. Currency beyond this point will be destroyed.

How will fulfilment take place?
-------------------------------

Most fulfilment will happen via website. You will be notified when your item is fulfilled.\
In the event, if your item is wayyy overpriced. You will be dmed by someone to either:

A. Be asked to give us a link on what thing we should buy for you, on your behalf (for high priced items)\
Or\
B. Be given a grant to buy the item yourself (for more, lower priced items)\
Or\
C. Be given a refund on your currency.

There is an option to get your own 3d printer. The price of the printer can be anywhere from $180 dollars (will be 200 dollars if you don't have any other options to choose from) to an indefinite amount!\
Note: if you spend your grant for anything other then the given purpose, we will ask for the full amount you owe us, and if not repaid by the end of deadline, you will be banned from construct and will face further repercussions.\
Please don't buy McDonald's and Nike's :hdheavysob:

What software do you support?
-----------------------------

Here's the list of software you can use:

-   Fusion 360
-   Onshape
-   Solidworks
-   FreeCAD
-   OpenSCAD
-   Blender
-   CATIA
-   Creo
-   Siemens NX
-   Rhino

No TinkerCAD or SketchUp please.

What's the minimum hours per project?
-------------------------------------

The minimum is 2 hours per project.

I'm new to CAD design and it takes me longer to complete tasks. Is that okay?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Absolutely! We welcome beginners. However, please note that research/tutorials time (like looking up how to perform specific functions in your software) is not counted toward your project hours. Only active work on the project itself counts.

Is Construct double dippable?
-----------------------------

Unfortunately no. Double dipping will lead to your project getting deleted.

Who runs this?
